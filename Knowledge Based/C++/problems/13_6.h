/** What is name hiding in C++?
 * ==============================
 * In C++, when you have a class with an overloaded method, and you then extend
 * and override that method, you must override all of the overloaded methods.
**/

class FirstClass {
public:
	virtual void MethodA (int);
	virtual void MethodA (int, int);
};

void FirstClass::MethodA (int i) {
	std::cout << "ONE!!\n";
}

void FirstClass::MethodA (int i, int j) {
	std::cout << "TWO!!\n";
}

/** This is a simple class with two methods (or one overloaded method).
 * If you want to override the one-parameter version, you can do the following:
**/

class SecondClass : public FirstClass {
public:
	void MethodA (int);
};

void SecondClass::MethodA (int i) {
	std::cout << "THREE!!\n";
}

void test2() {
	SecondClass a;
	a.MethodA (1);
//	a.MethodA (1, 1);
}

/** However, the second call wonâ€™t work, since the two-parameter MethodA is not visible.
 * That is name hiding.
**/
